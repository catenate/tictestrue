nb justify project
I thought I'd use this little project as an opportunity to practice
aspects of disciplined TDD, Ruby, and XP. So, I set up a github
project;¹ reused an elementary output-diff test framework I wrote for
shell scripts with predictable output (not actually in the repository);
started writing tests before I wrote any Ruby code; and track what I'm
doing as user stories (features, and no-point chores) in a public
Pivotal Tracker project.²
