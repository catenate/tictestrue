Test-driven tic-tac-toe in Ruby 1.9.1.

`make` (or `mk` if you installed plan9port) converts \*.ℛℬ (unicode ruby)
files to \*.rb using toascii.sed, and runs unit tests.

`./testcmd ttt` (expects /usr/local/plan9/bin/rc) runs user-interface
whole-program tests.

`./ttt.rb` runs the tic-tac-toe program.

`spec spec` (in progress) runs RSpec behavior tests.

Tasks tracked in the file kanban, and at http://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/82400
